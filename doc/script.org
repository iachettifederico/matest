* Matest
** Small testing framework
** Natural assertions
*** Non natural
  - assert_equal(1, var)
  - var.should == 1
  - expect(var).to eql(1)
*** Natural
  - var == 1
* Rules
** Sandi Metz's
  1. Classes/Modules/files can be no longer than one hundred lines of code.
  2. Methods can be no longer than five lines of code.
  3. Pass no more than four parameters into a method. Hash options are parameters.
** From Sandi talks
*** No if/case statements
  - if/unless
  - case
  - ternary if
  - `&&`, `||`
** Test everything
- Apply TDD
- Start with RSpec, but move to Matest once it's usable again
* After thoughts
** I may take this topic again
** Communicate with me if
- there's anything you considered I've done wrong or I can improve
- there's something I don't know how to do yet and you have an idea
- you wanna char and/or pair with me
